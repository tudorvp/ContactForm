# ContactForm
A simple Contact Form using CSS/HTML/BOOTSTRAP/JavaScript/SQL

This is a homwork made for a course that I took.

This can be hosted locally using a localhost server like MAMP/XAMPP also you have the possibility to use the phpMyAdmin DB directly from it for testing purposes. 

Everything from the form is in the Romanian language. 
From top - bottom.
Nume = Last Name
Prenume = First Name
Username = Username
Parola = Password
Introduceti adres de email = Please insert your email adress
Gen = Gender (Masculin = Male, Feminin = Female) 
The checkbox is asking if you agree that your information will be processed. 

Thank you for checking this out, hope it will help you!
